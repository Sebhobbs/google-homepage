This project aims to deconstruct a web page, and create a new webpage similar or identical in appearance (not functionality) to the first. 

The purpose is to practise using HTML and CSS, as a learning experience. This is the first project in The Odin Project's Web Development 101. 

Edit upon completing the assignment: by working on this project, with hours of experimentation and research, I improved my understanding of:
- what html elements are required to make a web page
- how to structure html elements in a web page
- how to position elements using css
- how to format text and elements such as search bars, links, images and buttons using css.
